## Description
CMB2 Taxonomy will create metaboxes and forms with custom fields for your taxonomies using the [CMB2](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2) API (and yes, it will blow your mind too).

To get started, please follow the examples in the included `example-functions.php` file and have a look at the [basic usage instructions](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Basic-Usage).

You can see a list of available field types [here](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/wiki/Field-Types#types).
